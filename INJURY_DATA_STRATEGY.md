# 🏥 NFL Injury Data Integration Strategy

## 🎯 **Why Injury Data is CRITICAL**

**Injury reports are the #1 factor that moves betting lines** - often more than any other single data point.

### **Real Impact Examples:**
- **Star QB injury:** Lines can move 3-7 points instantly
- **Top WR out:** Team totals drop 3-6 points
- **Key defensive player:** Opponent totals increase 2-4 points
- **O-Line injuries:** Massive impact on rushing/passing efficiency

## 📊 **How Injuries Affect Our Analysis**

### **1. Betting Line Movements** 💰
```javascript
// Example: Mahomes injury impact
const lineMovement = {
  beforeInjury: { spread: -7.5, total: 52.5 },
  afterInjury: { spread: -3.5, total: 47.5 },
  impact: "4-point spread swing, 5-point total drop"
};
```

### **2. Player Performance Predictions** 📈
- **Replacement players:** Dramatically different skill levels
- **Game script changes:** Teams adjust strategy around injuries
- **Snap count redistribution:** Other players get more opportunities

### **3. Team Strategy Shifts** 🏈
- **Offensive adjustments:** Run-heavy vs pass-heavy
- **Defensive vulnerabilities:** Exploit injured positions
- **Special teams impact:** Kicker/punter injuries affect field position

### **4. Historical Pattern Analysis** 📊
- **Team performance without key players**
- **Backup player historical performance**
- **Injury-prone player patterns**
