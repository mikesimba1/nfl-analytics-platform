# ðŸ”§ NFL Analytics Platform - Fixes Applied

## Summary
All runtime errors have been resolved and the platform is now fully operational with comprehensive NFL analytics data.

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **TypeError: g.weather.toLowerCase is not a function**
**Problem**: GameAnalysis component was treating weather as a string when it's actually an object.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `Game` interface to properly define weather as an object with properties:
  ```typescript
  weather?: {
    conditions: string;
    impact: string;
    temperature: number;
    windSpeed: number;
    precipitationChance: number;
  };
  ```
- Fixed weather filtering logic to check `weather.conditions` and `weather.impact`
- Added weather icons and proper display formatting

### 2. **Interface Mismatches in PlayerProps**
**Problem**: Component expected 'OVER'/'UNDER' recommendations but API returns 'STRONG PLAY'/'MODERATE PLAY'/'PASS'.

**Solution**:
- Updated `PlayerProp` interface to match actual API response
- Fixed recommendation color coding for new values
- Added proper handling for injury status and game script data
- Enhanced display with season baselines and key factors

### 3. **Week Selector Issues**
**Problem**: Components were using incorrect week calculations (18-i).

**Solution**:
- Fixed all week selectors to use simple array: `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`
- Applied to GameAnalysis, PlayerProps, CheatSheets, and Matchups components

### 4. **API Response Structure Mismatches**
**Problem**: Frontend components didn't match the comprehensive backend API structure.

**Solution**:
- Updated all interfaces to match actual API responses
- Added support for new fields: ELO ratings, DVOA metrics, betting edges, motivation factors
- Enhanced data display with all available analytics
